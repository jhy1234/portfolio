                <p>Suffering From Tattoo Regret?</p>
                <p>People change, and as they do “tattoo regret” can take over. Tattoo regret can happen over all kinds of tattoos. Maybe it’s the name of an ex or even just a poorly done tattoo, either way, this problem does have an awesome fix. Cover-ups!</p>
                <p>Cover-ups are a fantastically creative way to breathe new life into old tattoos. Some people opt to simply remold an old design into a more updated/better version of the piece, while others prefer to completely block out any evidence of the old tattoo. If the regret is strong, people usually go with the second option. Of the two, it can also be the more challenging, which is why it’s advisable to go to an artist that you know has significant skill in this area. </p>

                <h1>Tattoo Removal</h1>
                <h2>Not Happy with an Old Tattoo?</h2>
                <p>Laser tattoo removal is the process of removing embedded ink from the layers of skin using a laser. Lasers work by producing short pulses of intense light that selectively target the tattoo pigment while minimizing damage to the surrounding skin. The laser energy causes the tattoo pigment to fragment into smaller particles that are then easily removed by the body’s immune system. Lasers offer a non-invasive and effective treatment for unwanted tattoos. Tattoo fading is for individuals who want to lighten their existing tattoo in order to facilitate a cover up. The procedure is the same as laser tattoo removal, but requires less sessions.</p>
                <h2>What types of tattoos can be removed?</h2>
                <p>The majority of tattoos fade quite effectively. Black is removed most easily. Colours like blue and green can be more difficult to remove.</p>
                <h2>How does the laser tattoo removal treatment work?</h2>
                <p>Using a MedLight4, powerful laser light pulses breakdown the tattoo ink in the skin. The fragmented particles are then removed by the body’s immune or lymphatic system.</p>
